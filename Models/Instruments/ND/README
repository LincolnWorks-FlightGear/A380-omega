============================= NAVIGATION DISPLAY ===============================

Based on the FG Generic ND using canvas mapStructure.

The model and XML are integrated into the FlightDeck model - if you came here looking to copy this ND into your aircraft, try the 777/747-400 instead.

============================= WEATHER RADAR LAYER ==============================
WunderMap Live WXRadar Instrument
Narendran M (c) 2014

To be able to use the weather radar, you require a subscription the wunderground's API. You can get a developer key for FREE which lets you submit 500 calls per day at about 10 calls per minute.

The WXR instrument has been designed to make only 1 call per 15 minutes as the weather information does not change that often. The received data is then modified to match current situation.

You can acquire a free subscription to the API here - http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/

Once you sign up to the service, you will receive a key ID formed with various alphanumberic characters - copy that key ID and paste it into the api-key field in the /A380-omega/Models/Instruments/WXR/api_key.xml file

============================== !IMPORTANT NOTE! ================================

This instrument will only work in displaying WunderMap's Radar/Satellite layer for real/Live Weather data. Please enable Live Data in your Weather Dialog to make full use of this instrument.

The WXR Layer will NOT match your weather IF you are using custom simulated weather data.

The Displayed Radar/Satellite Layers belong to http://www.wunderground.com and NOT the aircraft/instrument developer. (aka. me)
